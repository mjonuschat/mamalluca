# Mamalluca

Mamalluca is a Prometheus exporter for Klipper and Moonraker to instrument and capture metrics for your 3D printer.

Each Mamalluca instance will monitor a single Moonraker instance and export metrics on a dedicated HTTP listener.
Mamalluca does not need to run on the same host as Moonraker as long as it can establish a Websocket connection to the Moonraker instance.

Mamalluca provides a Prometheus scrape target over HTTP on a configurable port.

**Checking metrics exporter**

By default the metrics exporter listens on all interfaces of the computer on port `9000`. Assuming your printer is reachable with the name `printer.local` you can open [http://printer.local:9000/](http://printer.local:9000/) and see the metrics that are being exported so far.

### Running the exporter in the background

Use the following instructions to create and enable a systemd unit file to start Mamalluca. Make sure to adjust the paths and usernames as needed if your user is not named `pi`.

```bash
cd $HOME/mamalluca
nano $HOME/mamalluca/mamalluca.service
sudo systemctl link mamalluca/mamalluca.service
sudo systemctl enable mamalluca
sudo systemctl start mamalluca
```

**mamalluca.service**
```text
[Unit]
Description=Moonraker/Klipper Prometheus Exporter
Documentation=https://github.com/mjonuschat/mamalluca
After=moonraker.service

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

[Service]

WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/mamalluca
ExecStart=/home/pi/mamalluca/mamalluca -v

```

**Verifying Mamalluca is running**

The following command should show that the service is active and running:

```bash
systemctl status mamalluca
```

```text
